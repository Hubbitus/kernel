 is the normal PLL6 output, or "pll6". The second output is rate doubled
 PLL6, or "pll6x2".
 
+The "allwinner,sunxi-multi-bus-gates-clk" holds the actual clocks in
+child nodes, where each one specifies the parent clock that the particular
+gates are depending from. The child nodes each follow the common clock
+binding as described in this document.

 The "allwinner,*-mmc-clk" clocks have three different outputs: the
 main clock, with the ID 0, and the output and sample clocks, with the
 IDs 1 and 2, respectively.
