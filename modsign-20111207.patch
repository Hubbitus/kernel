+			    CRYPTOGRAPHIC KEY TYPE
+			    ======================
+
+Contents:
+
+  - Overview.
+  - Key identification.
+  - Accessing crypto keys.
+  - Implementing crypto parsers.
+  - Implementing crypto subtypes.
+
+
+========
+OVERVIEW
+========
+
+The "crypto" key type is designed to be a container for cryptographic keys,
+without imposing any particular restrictions on the form of the cryptography or
+the key.
+
+The crypto key is given a subtype that defines what sort of data is associated
+with the key and provides operations to describe and destroy it.  However, no
+requirement is made that the key data actually be loaded into the key.
+
+The crypto key also has a number of data parsers registered with it.  The data
+parsers are responsible for extracing information the blobs of data passed to
+the instantiator function.  The first data parser that recognises the blob gets
+to set the subtype of the key and define the operations that can be done on
+that key.
+
+Completely in-kernel key retention and operation subtypes and parsers can be
+defined, but it would also be possible to provide access to cryptographic
+hardware (such as a TPM) that might be used to both retain the relevant key and
+perform operations using that key.  In such a case, the crypto key would then
+merely be an interface to the TPM driver.
+
+
+==================
+KEY IDENTIFICATION
+==================
+
+Because the identity of a key is not necessarily known and may not be easily
+calculated when a crypto key is allocated, it may not be a simple matter to set
+a key description to something that's useful for determining whether this is
+the key you're looking for.  Furthermore, it may be necessary to perform a
+partial match upon the key identity.
+
+To help with this, when a key is loaded, the parser calculates the key
+fingerprint and stores a copy in the key structure.
+
+The crypto key type's key matching function then performs more checks than just
+the straightforward comparison of the description with the criterion string:
+
+ (1) If the criterion string is of the form "id:<hexdigits>" then the match
+     function will examine a key's fingerprint to see if the hex digits given
+     after the "id:" match the tail.  For instance:
+
+	keyctl search @s crypto id:5acc2142
+
+     will match a key with fingerprint:
+
+	1A00 2040 7601 7889 DE11  882C 3823 04AD 5ACC 2142
+
+ (2) If the criterion string is of the form "<subtype>:<hexdigits>" then the
+     match will match the ID as in (1), but with the added restriction that
+     only keys of the specified subtype (e.g. dsa or rsa) will be matched.  For
+     instance:
+
+	keyctl search @s crypto dsa:5acc2142
+
+Looking in /proc/keys, the last 8 hex digits of the key fingerprint are
+displayed, along with the subtype:
+
+	1a39e171 I-----     1 perm 3f010000     0     0 crypto    modsign.0: DSA 5acc2142 []
+
+
+=====================
+ACCESSING CRYPTO KEYS
+=====================
+
+To access crypto keys from within the kernel, the following inclusion is
+required:
+
+	#include <keys/crypto-type.h>
+
+This gives access to the key type:
+
+	struct key_type key_type_crypto;
+
+
+===========================
+IMPLEMENTING CRYPTO PARSERS
+===========================
+
+The crypto key type keeps a list of registered data parsers.  An example of
+such a parser is one that parses OpenPGP packet formatted data [RFC 4880].
+
+During key instantiation each parser in the list is tried until one doesn't
+return -EBADMSG.
+
+The parser definition structure looks like the following:
+
+	struct crypto_key_parser {
+		struct module		*owner;
+		const char		*name;
+
+		int (*instantiate)(struct key *key,
+				   const void *data, size_t datalen);
+	};
+
+The owner and name fields should be set to the owning module and the name of
+the parser.
+
+There are a number of operations defined by the parser.  They are all optional,
+but it is expected that at least one will be defined.
+
+ (1) instantiate().
+
+     The arguments are the same as for the instantiate function in the key
+     type.  'key' is the crypto key being instantiated; data and datalen are
+     the instantiation data, presumably containing cryptographic key data, and
+     the length of that data.
+
+     If the data format is not recognised, -EBADMSG should be returned.  If it
+     is recognised, but the key cannot for some reason be set up, some other
+     negative error code should be returned.
+
+     If the key can be successfully set up, then key->payload should be set to
+     point to the retained data, key->type_data.p[0] should be set to point to
+     the subtype chosen and key->type_data.p[1] should be set to point to a
+     copy of the key's identity string and 0 should be returned.
+
+     The key's identity string may be partially matched upon.  For a public-key
+     algorithm such as RSA and DSA this will likely be a printable hex version
+     of the key's fingerprint.
+
+Functions are provided to register and unregister parsers:
+
+	int register_crypto_key_parser(struct crypto_key_parser *parser);
+	void unregister_crypto_key_parser(struct crypto_key_parser *subtype);
+
+Parsers may not have the same name.  The names are only used for displaying in
+debugging messages.
+
+
+============================
+IMPLEMENTING CRYPTO SUBTYPES
+============================
+
+The parser selects the appropriate subtype directly and sets it on the key; the
+crypto key then retains a reference on the subtype module (which means the
+parser can be removed thereafter).
+
+The subtype definition structure looks like the following:
+
+	struct crypto_key_subtype {
+		struct module		*owner;
+		const char		*name;
+
+		void (*describe)(const struct key *key, struct seq_file *m);
+		void (*destroy)(void *payload);
+	};
+
+The owner and name fields should be set to the owning module and the name of
+the subtype.
+
+There are a number of operations defined by the subtype:
+
+ (1) describe().
+
+     Mandatory.  This allows the subtype to display something in /proc/keys
+     against the key.  For instance the name of the public key algorithm type
+     could be displayed.  The key type will display the tail of the key
+     identity string after this.
+
+ (2) destroy().
+
+     Mandatory.  This should free the memory associated with the key.  The
+     crypto key will look after freeing the fingerprint and releasing the
+     reference on the subtype module.

From 9d66ee5300d0d1391367dd002eba6663aaf33760 Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>

Subject: KEYS: Add signature verification facility

Add a facility whereby a key subtype may be asked to verify a signature against
the data it is purported to have signed.

This adds four routines:

 (1) struct crypto_key_verify_context *
     verify_sig_begin(struct key *keyring, const void *sig, size_t siglen);

     This sets up a verification context for the given signature using
     information in that signature to select a key from the specified keyring
     and to request a hash algorithm from the crypto layer.

 (2) int verify_sig_add_data(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx,
			     const void *data, size_t datalen);

     Incrementally supply data to be signed.  May be called multiple times.

 (3) int verify_sig_end(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx,
			const void *sig, size_t siglen);

     Complete the verification process and return the result.  -EKEYREJECTED
     will indicate that the verification failed and 0 will indicate success.
     Other errors are also possible.

 (4) void verify_sig_cancel(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx);

     Cancel the verification process.

+SIGNATURE VERIFICATION
+----------------------
+
+The four operations that can perform cryptographic signature verification,
+using one of a set of keys to provide the public key:
+
+ (1) Begin verification procedure.
+
+	struct crypto_key_verify_context *
+	verify_sig_begin(struct key *keyring, const void *sig, size_t siglen);
+
+     This function sets up a verification context from the information in the
+     signature and looks for a suitable key in the keyring.  The signature blob
+     must be presented again at the end of the procedure.  The keys will be
+     checked against parameters in the signature, and if the matching one is
+     not found then -ENOKEY will be returned.
+
+     The hashing algorithm, if such a thing applies, will be determined from
+     information in the signature and the appropriate crypto module will be
+     used.  -ENOPKG will be returned if the hash algorithm is unavailable.
+
+     The return value is an opaque pointer to be passed to the other functions,
+     or a negative error code.
+
+ (2) Indicate data to be verified.
+
+	int verify_sig_add_data(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx,
+				const void *data, size_t datalen);
+
+     This function is used to shovel data to the verification procedure so that
+     it can load it into the hash, pass it to hardware or whatever is
+     appropriate for the algorithm being employed.
+
+     The data is not canonicalised for the document type specified in the
+     signature.  The caller must do that.
+
+     It will return 0 if successful and a negative error code if not.
+
+ (3) Complete the verification process.
+
+	int verify_sig_end(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx,
+			   const void *sig, size_t siglen);
+
+     This function performs the actual signature verification step and cleans
+     up the resources allocated at the beginning.  The signature must be
+     presented again as some of the data therein may need to be added to the
+     internal hash.
+
+     It will return -EKEYREJECTED if the signature didn't match, 0 if
+     successful and may return other errors as appropriate.
+
+ (4) Cancel the verification process.
+
+	void verify_sig_cancel(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx);
+
+     This function cleans up the resources allocated at the beginning.  This is
+     not necessary if verify_sig_end() was called.

 The crypto key type keeps a list of registered data parsers.  An example of

+ (2) verify_sig_begin().
+
+     This is similar in concept to the instantiate() function, except that it
+     is given a signature blob to parse rather than a key data blob.
+
+     If the data format is not recognised, -EBADMSG should be returned.  If it
+     is recognised, but the signature verification process cannot for some
+     reason be set up, some other negative error code should be returned.
+     -ENOKEY should be used to indicate that no matching key is available and
+     -ENOPKG should be returned if the hash algorithm or the verification
+     algorithm are unavailable.
+
+     If successful, the parser should allocate a verification context and embed
+     the following struct in it:
+
+	struct crypto_key_verify_context {
+		struct key *key;
+		int (*add_data)(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx,
+				const void *data, size_t datalen);
+		int (*end)(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx,
+			   const u8 *sig, size_t siglen);
+		void (*cancel)(struct crypto_key_verify_context *ctx);
+	};
+
+     and return a pointer to this to the caller, who will then pass it to the
+     verification operation wrappers described in the "Signature Verification"
+     section.  The three operation pointers here correspond exactly to those
+     wrappers and are all mandatory.  container_of() should be used to retrieve
+     the actual context.
+
+     Note that the crypto key type retains a reference on the parser module for
+     the lifetime of this context, though the operation pointers need not point
+     into this module.
+
+     The parser should also record a pointer to the key selected and take a
+     reference on that key with key_get().

From 6fc88dcf4610907920e8ec8fc9d11610a23b12ae Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:07:11 +0000
Subject: KEYS: RSA signature verification algorithm

Implement the RSA algorithm (PKCS#1 / RFC3447).  At this time, only signature
verification is supported.  This uses the asymmetric public key subtype to hold
its key data.

Subject: PGPLIB: Basic packet parser

Provide a simple parser that extracts the packets from a PGP packet blob and
passes the desirous ones to the given processor function:

	struct pgp_parse_context {
		u64 types_of_interest;
		int (*process_packet)(struct pgp_parse_context *context,
				      enum pgp_packet_tag type,
				      u8 headerlen,
				      const u8 *data,
				      size_t datalen);
	};

	int pgp_parse_packets(const u8 *data, size_t datalen,
			      struct pgp_parse_context *ctx);

This is configured on with CONFIG_PGP_LIBRARY.

Subject: PGPLIB: Signature parser

Provide some PGP signature parsing helpers:

 (1) A function to parse V4 signature subpackets and pass the desired ones to
     a processor function:

	int pgp_parse_sig_subpkts(const u8 *data, size_t datalen,
				  struct pgp_parse_sig_context *ctx);

 (2) A function to parse out basic signature parameters from any PGP signature
     such that the algorithms and public key can be selected:

	int pgp_parse_sig_params(const u8 **_data, size_t *_datalen,
				 struct pgp_sig_parameters *p);

From ee32f2d2d24a635e7bb46cbd37a0622850f4c66e Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:07:13 +0000
Subject: KEYS: PGP data parser

Implement a PGP data parser for the crypto key type to use when instantiating a
key.

This parser attempts to parse the instantiation data as a PGP packet sequence
(RFC 4880) and if it parses okay, attempts to extract a public-key algorithm
key or subkey from it.

If it finds such a key, it will set up a public_key subtype payload with
appropriate handler routines (DSA or RSA) and attach it to the key.

Subject: KEYS: PGP-based public key signature verification

Provide handlers for PGP-based public-key algorithm signature verification.
This does most of the work involved in signature verification as most of it is
public-key algorithm agnostic.  The public-key verification algorithm itself
is just the last little bit and is supplied the complete hash data to process.

This requires glue logic putting on top to make use of it - something the next
patch provides.

Subject: KEYS: PGP format signature parser

Implement a signature parser that will attempt to parse a signature blob as a
PGP packet format message.  If it can, it will find an appropriate crypto key
and set the public-key algorithm according to the data in the signature.

Subject: KEYS: Provide a function to load keys from a PGP keyring blob

Provide a function to load keys from a PGP keyring blob for use in initialising
the module signing key keyring:

	int load_PGP_keys(const u8 *pgpdata, size_t pgpdatalen,
			  struct key *keyring, const char *descprefix);

The keys are labelled with descprefix plus a number to uniquify them.  The keys
will actually be identified by the ID calculated from the PGP data rather than
by the description, so this shouldn't be a problem.

The keys are attached to the keyring supplied.

Looking as root in /proc/keys after the module signing keyring has been loaded:

24460d1c I-----     1 perm 3f010000     0     0 crypto    modsign.0: dsa 5acc2142 []
3ca85723 I-----     1 perm 1f010000     0     0 keyring   .module_sign: 1/4

From a66294fc859a6a9374a6d873d8a6ca3ec683538f Mon Sep 17 00:00:00 2001
From: David Howells <dhowells@redhat.com>
Date: Wed, 7 Dec 2011 14:07:17 +0000
Subject: MODSIGN: Module ELF verifier

Do preliminary verification of the ELF structure of a module.  This is used to
make sure that the ELF structure can then be used to check the module signature
and access the module data without breaking the module loader.

If the module's ELF metadata is determined to be bad, then ELIBBAD will be
returned and a message will be logged to the kernel log.

Subject: MODSIGN: Apply signature checking to modules on module load

Apply signature checking to modules on module load, checking the signature
against the ring of public keys compiled into the kernel (if enabled by
CONFIG_MODULE_SIG).  Turning on signature checking will also force the module's
ELF metadata to be verified first.

These patches have been in use by RHEL and Fedora kernels for years, and so
have been thoroughly tested.  The signed modules survive both the debuginfo
separation performed by rpmbuild and the strip performed when modules are being
reduced as much as possible before being included in an initial ramdisk
composition.  Signed modules have been tested to work with LE and BE, 32- and
64-bit arch kernels, including i386, x86_64, ppc64, ia64, s390 and s390x.

There are several reasons why these patches are useful, amongst which are:

 (1) to protect against accidentally-corrupted modules causing damage;

 (2) to protect against maliciously modified modules causing damage;

 (3) to allow a sysadmin (or more likely an IT department) to enforce a policy
     that only known and approved modules shall be loaded onto machines which
     they're expected to support;

 (4) to allow other support providers to do likewise, or at least to _detect_
     the fact that unsupported modules are loaded;

 (5) to allow the detection of modules replaced by a second-order distro or a
     preloaded Linux purveyor.

These patches have two main appeals: (a) preventing malicious modules from
being loaded, and (b) reducing support workload by pointing out modules on a
crashing box that aren't what they're expected to be.

Now, this is not a complete solution by any means: the core kernel is not
protected, and nor are /dev/mem or /dev/kmem, but it denies (or at least
controls) one relatively simple attack vector.

This facility is optional: the builder of a kernel is by no means under any
requirement to actually enable it, let alone force the set of loadable modules
to be restricted to just those that the builder provides (there are degrees of
restriction available).

Use of the module signing facility is documentated in:

	Documentation/module-signing.txt

which I've included here for reference:

			==============================
			KERNEL MODULE SIGNING FACILITY
			==============================

The module signing facilitiy applies cryptographic signature checking to
modules on module load, checking the signature against a ring of public keys
compiled into the kernel.  GPG is used to do the cryptographic work and
determines the format of the signature and key data.  The facility uses GPG's
MPI library to handle the huge numbers involved.

This facility is enabled through CONFIG_MODULE_SIG.  Turning on signature
checking will also force the module's ELF metadata to be verified before the
signature is checked.

=====================
SUPPLYING PUBLIC KEYS
=====================

A set of public keys must be supplied at main kernel compile time.  This is
done by taking a GPG public key file, running it through the kernel's bin2c
program and writing the result over crypto/signature/key.h.  To automate this
process, something like this could be done:

	cat >genkey <<EOF
	%pubring kernel.pub
	%secring kernel.sec
	Key-Type: DSA
	Key-Length: 512
	Name-Real: A. N. Other
	Name-Comment: Kernel Module GPG key
	%commit
	EOF
	make scripts/bin2c
	gpg --homedir . --batch --gen-key genkey

The above generates fresh keys using /dev/random.  If there's insufficient data
in /dev/random, more can be provided more by running:

	rngd -r /dev/urandom

in the background.

Note:

 (1) That "keyname" is the name of the key in the keyring.  This differentiates
     it from any other keys that may be added to the keyring.

 (2) That no GPG password is used in the above scriptlet.

 (3) It may be desirable to shred and delete the private key file after signing
     the modules.

==============
MODULE SIGNING
==============

Modules will then be signed automatically.  The kernel make command line can
include the following options:

 (*) MODSECKEY=<secret-key-ring-path>

     This indicates the whereabouts of the GPG keyring that is the source of
     the secret key to be used.  The default is "./kernel.sec".

 (*) MODPUBKEY=<public-key-ring-path>

     This indicates the whereabouts of the GPG keyring that is the source of
     the public key to be used.  The default is "./kernel.pub".

 (*) MODKEYNAME=<key-name>

     The name of the key pair to be used from the aforementioned keyrings.
     This defaults to being unset, thus leaving the choice of default key to
     gpg.

 (*) KEYFLAGS="gpg-options"

     Override the complete gpg command line, including the preceding three
     options.  The default options supplied to gpg are:

	--no-default-keyring
	--secret-keyring $(MODSECKEY)
	--keyring $(MODPUBKEY)
	--no-default-keyring
	--homedir .
	--no-options
	--no-auto-check-trustdb
	--no-permission-warning

      with:

	--default-key $(MODKEYNAME)

      being added if requested.

The resulting module.ko file will be the signed module.

========================
STRIPPING SIGNED MODULES
========================

Signed modules may be safely stripped as the signature only covers those parts
of the module the kernel actually uses and any ELF metadata required to deal
with them.  Any necessary ELF metadata that is affected by stripping is
canonicalised by the sig generator and the sig checker to hide strip effects.

This permits the debuginfo to be detached from the module and placed in another
spot so that gdb can find it when referring to that module without the need for
multiple signed versions of the module.  Such is done by rpmbuild when
producing RPMs.

It also permits the module to be stripped as far as possible for when modules
are being reduced prior to being included in an initial ramdisk composition.

======================
LOADING SIGNED MODULES
======================

Modules are loaded with insmod, exactly as for unsigned modules.  The signature
is inserted into the module object file as an ELF section called ".module_sig".
The signature checker will spot it and apply signature checking.

=========================================
NON-VALID SIGNATURES AND UNSIGNED MODULES
=========================================

If CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is enabled or "enforcemodulesig=1" is supplied on
the kernel command line, the kernel will _only_ load validly signed modules
for which it has a public key.  Otherwise, it will also load modules that are
unsigned.  Any module for which the kernel has a key, but which proves to have
a signature mismatch will not be permitted to load (returning EKEYREJECTED).

This table indicates the behaviours of the various situations:

	MODULE STATE			PERMISSIVE MODE	ENFORCING MODE
	===============================	===============	===============
	Unsigned			Ok		EKEYREJECTED
	Signed, no public key		ENOKEY		ENOKEY
	Validly signed, public key	Ok		Ok
	Invalidly signed, public key	EKEYREJECTED	EKEYREJECTED
	Validly signed, expired key	EKEYEXPIRED	EKEYEXPIRED
	Corrupt signature		ELIBBAD		ELIBBAD
	Corrupt ELF			ELIBBAD		ELIBBAD

+			==============================
+			KERNEL MODULE SIGNING FACILITY
+			==============================
+
+The module signing facility applies cryptographic signature checking to modules
+on module load, checking the signature against a ring of public keys compiled
+into the kernel.  GPG is used to do the cryptographic work and determines the
+format of the signature and key data.  The facility uses GPG's MPI library to
+handle the huge numbers involved.
+
+This facility is enabled through CONFIG_MODULE_SIG.  Turning on signature
+checking will also force the module's ELF metadata to be verified before the
+signature is checked.
+
+The signature checker in the kernel is capable of handling multiple keys of
+either DSA or RSA type, and can support any of MD5, RIPE-MD-160, SHA-1,
+SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384 and SHA-512 hashes - PROVIDED(!) the requisite
+algorithms are compiled into the kernel.
+
+(!) NOTE: Modules may only be verified initially with algorithms compiled into
+the kernel.  Further algorithm modules may be loaded and used - but these must
+first pass a verification step using already loaded/compiled-in algorithms.
+
+
+=====================
+SUPPLYING PUBLIC KEYS
+=====================
+
+A set of public keys must be supplied at kernel image build time.  This is done
+by taking a GPG public key file and placing it in the base of the kernel
+directory in a file called kernel.pub.
+
+For example, a throwaway key could be generated automatically by something like
+the following:
+
+	cat >genkey <<EOF
+	%pubring kernel.pub
+	%secring kernel.sec
+	Key-Type: DSA
+	Key-Length: 512
+	Name-Real: A. N. Other
+	Name-Comment: Kernel Module GPG key
+	%commit
+	EOF
+	gpg --homedir . --batch --gen-key genkey
+
+The above generates fresh keys using /dev/random.  If there's insufficient data
+in /dev/random, more can be provided more by running:
+
+	rngd -r /dev/urandom
+
+in the background.
+
+Note that no GPG password is used in the above scriptlet.
+
+The kernel.pub file is compiled into the kernel directly by the assembler by
+means of an ".incbin" directive in kernel/modsign-pubkey.c.
+
+Once the kernel is running, the keys are visible to root as kernel crypto keys
+in /proc/keys in a keyring called .module_sign:
+
+335ab517 I-----     1 perm 1f030000     0     0 keyring   .module_sign: 2/4
+38d7d169 I-----     1 perm 3f010000     0     0 crypto    modsign.0: rsa 57532ca5 []
+195fa736 I-----     1 perm 3f010000     0     0 crypto    modsign.1: dsa 5acc2142 []
+
+This keyring can be listed with the keyctl program.  See:
+
+	Documentation/security/keys-crypto.txt
+
+for more information of crypto keys.
+
+
+============================
+SELECTING THE HASH ALGORITHM
+============================
+
+The hash algorithm to be used is selected by a multiple choice configuration
+item that enables one of the following variables:
+
+	CONFIG_SIG_SHA1
+	CONFIG_SIG_SHA224
+	CONFIG_SIG_SHA256
+	CONFIG_SIG_SHA384
+	CONFIG_SIG_SHA512
+
+These cause an appropriate "--digest-algo=" parameter to be passed to gpg when
+signing a module and force the appropriate hash algorithm to be compiled
+directly into the kernel rather than being built as a module.
+
+
+==============
+MODULE SIGNING
+==============
+
+Modules will then be signed automatically.  The kernel make command line can
+include the following options:
+
+ (*) MODSECKEY=<secret-key-ring-path>
+
+     This indicates the whereabouts of the GPG keyring that is the source of
+     the secret key to be used.  The default is "./kernel.sec".
+
+ (*) MODPUBKEY=<public-key-ring-path>
+
+     This indicates the whereabouts of the GPG keyring that is the source of
+     the public key to be used.  The default is "./kernel.pub".
+
+ (*) MODKEYNAME=<key-name>
+
+     The name of the key pair to be used from the aforementioned keyrings.
+     This defaults to being unset, thus leaving the choice of default key to
+     gpg.
+
+ (*) KEYFLAGS="gpg-options"
+
+     Override the complete gpg command line, including the preceding three
+     options.  The default options supplied to gpg are:
+
+	--no-default-keyring
+	--secret-keyring $(MODSECKEY)
+	--keyring $(MODPUBKEY)
+	--no-default-keyring
+	--homedir .
+	--no-options
+	--no-auto-check-trustdb
+	--no-permission-warning
+	--digest-algo=<hash-algorithm>
+
+      with:
+
+	--default-key $(MODKEYNAME)
+
+      being added if requested.
+
+The resulting module.ko file will be the signed module.
+
+
+========================
+STRIPPING SIGNED MODULES
+========================
+
+Signed modules may be safely stripped as the signature only covers those parts
+of the module the kernel actually uses and any ELF metadata required to deal
+with them.  Any necessary ELF metadata that is affected by stripping is
+canonicalised by the sig generator and the sig checker to hide strip effects.
+
+This permits the debuginfo to be detached from the module and placed in another
+spot so that gdb can find it when referring to that module without the need for
+multiple signed versions of the module.  Such is done by rpmbuild when
+producing RPMs.
+
+It also permits the module to be stripped as far as possible for when modules
+are being reduced prior to being included in an initial ramdisk composition.
+
+
+======================
+LOADING SIGNED MODULES
+======================
+
+Modules are loaded with insmod, exactly as for unsigned modules.  The signature
+is inserted into the module object file as an ELF section called ".module_sig".
+The signature checker will detect it and apply signature checking.
+
+
+=========================================
+NON-VALID SIGNATURES AND UNSIGNED MODULES
+=========================================
+
+If CONFIG_MODULE_SIG_FORCE is enabled or "enforcemodulesig=1" is supplied on
+the kernel command line, the kernel will _only_ load validly signed modules
+for which it has a public key.  Otherwise, it will also load modules that are
+unsigned.  Any module for which the kernel has a key, but which proves to have
+a signature mismatch will not be permitted to load (returning EKEYREJECTED).
+
+This table indicates the behaviours of the various situations:
+
+	MODULE STATE				PERMISSIVE MODE	ENFORCING MODE
+	=======================================	===============	===============
+	Unsigned				Ok		EKEYREJECTED
+	Signed, no public key			ENOKEY		ENOKEY
+	Validly signed, public key		Ok		Ok
+	Invalidly signed, public key		EKEYREJECTED	EKEYREJECTED
+	Validly signed, expired key		EKEYEXPIRED	EKEYEXPIRED
+	Signed, hash algorithm unavailable	ENOPKG		ENOPKG
+	Corrupt signature			EBADMSG		EBADMSG
+	Corrupt ELF				ELIBBAD		ELIBBAD
