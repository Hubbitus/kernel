Subject: [PATCH] HID: i2c-hid: Limit reads to wMaxInputLength bytes for input
 events

d1c7e29e8d27 (HID: i2c-hid: prevent buffer overflow in early IRQ)
changed hid_get_input() to read ihid->bufsize bytes, which can be
more than wMaxInputLength. This is the case with the Dell XPS 13
9343, and it is causing events to be missed. In some cases the
missed events are releases, which can cause the cursor to jump or
freeze, among other problems. Limit the number of bytes read to
min(wMaxInputLength, ihid->bufsize) to prevent such problems.
